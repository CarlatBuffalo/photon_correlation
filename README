Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code provided here is a suite of command-line tools for performing 
calculations on photon arrival data, as produced by hardware such as the 
PicoQuant PicoHarp and HydraHarp. The tasks covered include:
- correlation of photons to nth order 
- calculation of the approximate and exact normalization of the photon 
  correlation function to nth order 
- binning of photons to produce intensity traces 
- correlation of photon intensity traces to 2nd order
- conversion between photon data types
- performing any or all of the aforementioned tasks for subintervals of 
  experiment time (time-dependent lifetimes, etc)

In addition to performing such calculations, a suite of Python tools is 
provided to read and manipulate the results.
