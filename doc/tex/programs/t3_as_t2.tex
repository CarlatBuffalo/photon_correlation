\section{T3\_as\_t2}
\subsection{Purpose}
This program processes a stream of T3 photons and outputs a stream of T2 photons whose times are the pulse numbers of the T3 photons. This is useful if the time information of the T3 photon is not needed, as it simplifies later processing by not having to be concerned with the extra dimension.

\subsection{Command-line syntax}
%\input{"programs/t3_as_t2.usage"}

\subsubsection{Input}
The input is a stream of T3 photons, as specified in \program{picoquant}.

\subsubsection{Output}
The output is a stream of T2 photons, as specified in \program{picoquant}. These are formed by stripping the time dimension from each T3 photon, such that the T2 ``time'' dimension is now the pulse number.
