\section{Intensity\_to\_t2}
\subsection{Purpose}
This program converts a stream of time-tagged intensity to T2 photons, permitting a stream of integer counts to be treated as though it were composed of individual photons.

\subsection{Command-line syntax}
%\input{"programs/intensity_to_t2.usage"}

\subsubsection{Input}
The input is a stream of time-intensity pairs:
\begin{verbatim}
    time (long long), counts (unsigned int)
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Output}
The output is a stream of T2 photons generated from the given intensity at each time. By default, all photons are assigned to channel 0, but specifying some number of channels spreads the photons uniformly over those channels.

\subsection{Examples of usage}
\subsubsection{Photons on a single channel}
\begin{verbatim}
> cat counts
1,2
2,0
3,1
...
> intensity_to_t2 --file-in counts
0,1
0,1
0,3
...
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Photons on several channels}
\begin{verbatim}
> intensity_to_t2 --file-in counts --channels 4
1,1
2,1
2,3
...
\end{verbatim}
