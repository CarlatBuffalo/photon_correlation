General:
-write interface for Python, Matlab
-write automated test for all programs
-look into errno and related for dealing with errors.
-run valgrind against all programs, check that nothing has been missed.

Scripts:
-plotting for t3 mode correlation

Correlate:
-consider rewriting the correlator to be completely type-agnostic, and install custom accessors through a front-end to the generic correlator_t

Histogram:
-modify the backend such that allocation for each of the several modes (t2, t3 g, t3 g1) are performed separately.

Intensity:
-look into handling start, sotp properly

Bin intensity:
-track down all uses of window_dim or channel_dim and determine whether this is contributing to the excess io cost

Channels:

Correlate vector:
-take notes from notebook and compile the vector correlation method.
-for the delays, use an array of left/right to get the origin set correctly.

Intensity_to_t2:


Photons:
-add an option to specify the origin in time
