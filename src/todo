General:
-write interface for Python, Matlab
-write automated test for all programs
-look into errno and related for dealing with errors.
-run valgrind against all programs, check that nothing has been missed.

Scripts:
-plotting for t3 mode correlation

Correlate:

Histogram:
-modify the backend such that allocation for each of the several modes (t2, t3 g, t3 g1) are performed separately.

Intensity:

Bin intensity:

Time-dependent pl/gn:
-turn the Python scripts into C programs for speed?

Python:
-write interfaces to all types of output (photons, correlations, histograms, picoquant histograms, intensity)

Channels:

Correlate vector:
-take notes from notebook and compile the vector correlation method.
-for the delays, use an array of left/right to get the origin set correctly.

Intensity_to_t2:


Current:
-rewrite intensity to be an object: push values, print result
-rewrite correlator to be type-agnostic, accept a pushed values, inform user when a value is available
