General:
-write interface for Python, Matlab
-write automated test for all programs
-look into errno and related for dealing with errors.
-run valgrind against all programs, check that nothing has been missed.
-add lots of comments to explain implementations, etc.

Scripts:
-plotting for t3 mode correlation

Correlate:

Histogram:

Intensity:
-look into handling start, stop properly

Bin intensity:
-track down all uses of window_dim or channel_dim and determine whether this is contributing to the excess io cost

Channels:

Correlate vector:
-take notes from notebook and compile the vector correlation method.
-for the delays, use an array of left/right to get the origin set correctly.
