General:
-write interface for Python, Matlab
-write automated test for all programs
-look into errno and related for dealing with errors.
-run valgrind against all programs, check that nothing has been missed.
-add lots of comments to explain implementations, etc.
-reorganize and document the structure of the routines. 
-integrate intensity_correlate and photon_intensity_correlate?

photons:
-when applying a time offset to t3 data which would make the time negative, instead decrement the pulse number by the appropriate amount.
-apply offsets before determining what to do with the photon
