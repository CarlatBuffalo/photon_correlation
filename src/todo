General:
-write interface for Python, Matlab
-write automated test for all programs
-look into errno and related for dealing with errors.
-profile performance, and look to see if there are any obvious bottlenecks
-do a better job of detecting mode mismatch 
-remove the clunkier debug messages.
-check that all references to the channel are to _signed_ int
<<<<<<< HEAD
-change t3 to pulse, from pulse_number
=======
-offsets: create a program to add an offset to all photons in a stream, based on their channels, while keeping the stream in tempoeral order.
-byte alignment seems to be an issue. Would it be worthwhile to take advantage of all of the nice int32-type definitions to create properly platform-independent code?

Scripts:
-plotting for t3 mode correlation

Picoquant:

Correlate:

Histogram:
-should it be possible to re-initialize the histogram on command? This would save the trouble of allocating new memory each time we need to start a new histogram with the same settings. This could be done by separating the allocation/initiationalization/cleanup routines from the main histogram dispatch, permitting more direct control over the histogram process.
-replace the binary search algorithm with bsearch from stdlib
-merge the correlated_t2_t types with those from correlate_t2, such that only one interface remains. 

Intensity:

Bin intensity:
-get this going and put it in with the gn calculation for fully-normalized results

Time-dependent pl/gn:
-turn the Python scripts into C programs for speed?

Python:
-write interfaces to all types of output (photons, correlations, histograms, picoquant histograms, intensity)
-simplify histogram/correlate business: simply make tdg2 and tdpl by hard-wiring correlate and histogram, do not try to get fancy by piping those through Python objects. This just requires having a nice interface to photons through Python (already done) and a windowed stream (also already done).
-gn needs to pass all photons to correlate/histogram, intensity, bin_intensity

Channels:
-finish implementing offsets

Correlate vector:
-figure out a way to do a general vector correlation

Intensity_to_t2:
-put together some test data, make sure that the binary read is working
