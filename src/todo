Picoquant:
-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy: autocorrelation of summed signal
-build automated tests to check the output for each file type

> Testing:
>> Picoharp
-v20
--phd: linux64
--pt2: linux64
--pt3: linux64

>> Hydraharp
-v10
--hhd: linux64
--ht2: linux64
--ht3: linux64

>> TimeHarp
-v20 (software version 3.02, but format version 2.0? Data straight from the v302 sample data)
--thd: linux64
--thc: no
--t3r: written, but not tested

-v50
--thd: linux64
--thc: no
--t3r: matches the file demo, but the channel numbers seem really weird.

-v60:
--thd: linux64
--thc: no
--t3r: no

Correlate:
-for an integer overflow of the correlation, correlations should be set to null upon a free() call, but it does not appear to be. A failure sets the return value to null, but this behavior should be investigated more.
-implement binary output
-implement print_every and similar (or just get rid of it)
-use max-pulse-distance and max-time-distance to get a fine-tuned version of the correlation.

> Testing
>> t2: linux64
>> t3: linux64

Histogram:

Lifetime:
-turn t3 into histogram by turning all pulse numbers into 0, or just removing them entirely

Intensity:
-given a bin width, count the number of entries in a bin, then iterate until the end of the file.
