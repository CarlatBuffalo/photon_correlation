General:
-write interface for Python, Matlab
-write automated test for all programs
-look into errno and related for dealing with errors.
-run valgrind against all programs, check that nothing has been missed.
-add lots of comments to explain implementations, etc.
-rework the intensity system to support calculation from photon stream or reading from file. Populate a intensity_t which contains the information relevant to the current bin, such that a calculation can pull the result as it is populated.

Scripts:
-plotting for t3 mode correlation

Intensity correlate:
-integrate the intensity calculation into the process: use the specified bin-width to condition the photon stream and the histogram bins
