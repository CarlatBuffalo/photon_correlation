General:
-write interface for Python, Matlab
-write automated test for all programs
-look into errno and related for dealing with errors.
-profile performance, and look to see if there are any obvious bottlenecks
-do a better job of detecting mode mismatch 
-remove the clunkier debug messages.

Scripts:
-plotting for t3 mode correlation

Picoquant:
-find a way to deal with offsets. Maybe an external program which takes the records in and adds the offset, with a queue of some time length (equal to the largest offset seems reasonable) to reorder the records as needed.

-v30
--thd: linux32, linux64
--thc: no
--t3r: linux32, linux64. Seems to have a lot of special records, but things match up with the filedemo version of the reader.

-v60:

Histogram:
-check that the binary search judges the bin edges as the left or right bin edge
-t3 mode seems to be having problems with > 50000 time bins
> t2: done, need more thorough testing
> t3_g1: done, need more thorough testing
> t3_gn: done, need more thorough testing

Intensity:
> Testing
>> t2: linux64, linux32

General:
-make all routines more amenable to being used a a library
