General:
-write interface for Python, Matlab
-write automated test for all programs
-look into errno and related for dealing with errors.
-run valgrind against all programs, check that nothing has been missed.
-add lots of comments to explain implementations, etc.

Time dependent code:
-create a wrapper to gn which handles the creation and streaming of gn.td work. Basically, make it possible to yield the histograms, rather than just writing the file to a directory, so that binning can be done in real time instead.
-create similar wrappers for number and whatnot.
