General:
-write interface for Python, Matlab
-write automated test for all programs
-look into errno and related for dealing with errors.
-profile performance, and look to see if there are any obvious bottlenecks
-do a better job of detecting mode mismatch 
-remove the clunkier debug messages.
-check that all references to the channel are to _signed_ int

Scripts:
-plotting for t3 mode correlation

Picoquant:
-find a way to deal with offsets. Maybe an external program which takes the records in and adds the offset, with a queue of some time length (equal to the largest offset seems reasonable) to reorder the records as needed.

Correlate:

Histogram:
-should it be possible to re-initialize the histogram on command? This would save the trouble of allocating new memory each time we need to start a new histogram with the same settings.
-implement a linear search algorithm for linear scales

Intensity:

Bin intensity:
-get this going and put it in with the gn calculation for fully-normalized results

Time-dependent pl/gn:
-turn the Python scripts into C programs for speed
