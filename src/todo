General:
-write interface for Python, Matlab
-write automated test for all programs
-look into errno and related for dealing with errors.
-profile performance, and look to see if there are any obvious bottlenecks
-do a better job of detecting mode mismatch 
-remove the clunkier debug messages.
-check that all references to the channel are to _signed_ int
-offsets: create a program to add an offset to all photons in a stream, based on their channels, while keeping the stream in tempoeral order.

Scripts:
-plotting for t3 mode correlation

Picoquant:
-find a way to deal with offsets. Maybe an external program which takes the records in and adds the offset, with a queue of some time length (equal to the largest offset seems reasonable) to reorder the records as needed.

Correlate:
-move queue stuff into t2.c, make it possible to pass the maximum time distance as a separate parameter
-populate first-only: only permit each photon to be used once, and only retain information about the most recent photon on a given channel. Perhaps this should be a separate routine, since it is much simpler than the normal correlate (retain the latest photon on each channel, only output when all channels are populated)

Histogram:
-should it be possible to re-initialize the histogram on command? This would save the trouble of allocating new memory each time we need to start a new histogram with the same settings.
-implement a linear search algorithm for linear scales
-test to see if bsearch from stdlib.h is faster than the existing binary search algorithm.

Intensity:

Bin intensity:
-get this going and put it in with the gn calculation for fully-normalized results

Time-dependent pl/gn:
-turn the Python scripts into C programs for speed?

Python:
-write interfaces to all types of output (photons, correlations, histograms, picoquant histograms, intensity)
-simplify histogram/correlate business: simply make tdg2 and tdpl by hard-wiring correlate and histogram, do not try to get fancy by piping those through Python objects. This just requires having a nice interface to photons through Python (already done) and a windowed stream (also already done).
-gn needs to pass all photons to correlate/histogram, intensity, bin_intensity
