General:
-write interface for Python, Matlab
-write automated test for all programs
-look into errno and related for dealing with errors.
-run valgrind against all programs, check that nothing has been missed.

Scripts:
-plotting for t3 mode correlation

Picoquant:
-test the HydraHarp v20 overflow values for t2, t3 mode. 

Correlate:

Histogram:
-should it be possible to re-initialize the histogram on command? This would save the trouble of allocating new memory each time we need to start a new histogram with the same settings. This could be done by separating the allocation/initiationalization/cleanup routines from the main histogram dispatch, permitting more direct control over the histogram process.

Intensity:

Bin intensity:

Time-dependent pl/gn:
-turn the Python scripts into C programs for speed?

Python:
-write interfaces to all types of output (photons, correlations, histograms, picoquant histograms, intensity)

Channels:

Correlate vector:
-take notes from notebook and compile the vector correlation method.

Intensity_to_t2:
