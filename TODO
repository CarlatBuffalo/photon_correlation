-write interfaces to the calculations, results in Python, Matlab
-write automated test
-look into errno and related for dealing with errors.
-run valgrind against all programs, check that nothing has been missed.
-add lots of comments to explain implementations, etc.
-look into creating a single program which integrates all of the different operations on the photon stream.

Time dependent code:
-create a wrapper to gn which handles the creation and streaming of gn.td work. Basically, make it possible to yield the histograms, rather than just writing the file to a directory, so that binning can be done in real time instead.
-create similar wrappers for number and whatnot.

Integration with PicoQuant
-create a version of photon_gn which takes a photon stream directly through PicoQuant. This should speed up calculations

Photons:
-enable a t3 time offset: internally convert to t2, apply offset, convert back
